Whether you are an uber driver looking into new career opportunity or working QA professional looking to sharpen your fundamentals, this course will enlighten your learning process and shorten your learning curve. 
But first, let us answer some of the questions you might have.

### What is QA in simple words? - Example below

When you buy an apple, you can instantly verify its quality based on shape, ripeness, color etc. But only as you take a first bite, you will be able to see if an apple is really that good. 
Even an extremely good looking apple might taste sour or have a #BUG in it. As soon as you find a bug, you wanna yell or tell seller that there is a bug!!!
This is exactly same procedure you would do as a QA Engineer, with only few slight differences.

- You will have an app, instead of an apple
- You will not yell that you found a BUG, but rather write it down and describe it, and how did you find it
