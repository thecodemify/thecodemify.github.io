**Basics of Software Quality Assurance**

There are two main types of QAs:
- Manual: Engineers who perform testing without code knowledge
- Automation: Engineers who write code that does testing for them

Basics of manual testing:
- Actual testing
- Filing bug reports
- Writing test cases

If you are still not familiar with these basics of Software Quality Assurance, please check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL890EE4606BB9AC62" target="_blank">these 4 videos</a> to understand how to test applications and write bug reports. These are the two things that you need to know very well, as you will be asked to write a test case and a bug report in 90% of your interviews.
So, get pretty comfortable with it. And if you ever feel like this is not enough, just watch some more youtube videos or email us at admin@Codemify.com with a request to add more videos to these list.

You will need to pass these 3 languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Don't be afraid, it's pretty simple. And most people enjoy it :) To be honest, when went through it for the first time, I easily finished HTML/CSS but javascript took me a while. I had to google a lot of solutions for JS(javascript) challenges. But after it was finished, somehow :) I went through JS again and it was pretty clear then!


Do that, and then come back to our website and we will learn how to build automation framework from scratch!
