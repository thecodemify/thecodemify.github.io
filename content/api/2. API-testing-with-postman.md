## Let's install postman and send GET request

Postman, is a one of the most popular manual API testing tools

1. Download and install <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a>. When you open it for a first time, it will look like this:

2. Close "Create New" window

3. Copy/Paste this URL into url text box in a postman
	https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

4. Lets also add a header to our request that is basically like a requirement of what to expect.

![contentType](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33443927/73722774-270af380-46dc-11ea-9c85-0d38aae80cba.png)	


5. Now, lets send this GET request and see what the response will be.

6. As you see above, we got a list of users with their info in a response.
